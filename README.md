# job-board
Welcome to the Job Portal project! This application is designed to provide a platform for users to find and apply for job opportunities. It is built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack. Please keep in mind that this is the developer's first large-scale project, so the file structure might not be optimal.
